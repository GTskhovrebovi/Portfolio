Welcome to my portfolio! This Github repository is a collection of some of my personal projects, including project files.

## Project List

### Defender
This is a project i am currently working on. Game inspired from one of the warcraft III custom maps.
Player has to defend base from waves of enemies by killing them with 3 attacking options:
- click/tap for single target damage
- tap and hold to cast damaging AOE effect
- Heavy attack, wich generates over time and stuns the enemy while dealing huge damage.

there is also simple stats mechanics, similar to [Ball Blast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nomonkeys.ballblast&hl=en),
where defeated enemies give experience points/currency, wich can be spent on upgrades of these abilities.

currently working on level generation system, wich will generate waves, based on level number. (levels will be unlimited)

### Quarto
This is a game for two players, has 4x4 board and the 16 different pieces with four characteristics:
- Size (big/small)
- Colour (red/blue)
- Shape (circle/ square)
- Hole (piece with hole/piece without hole)  

Players move alternatively, placing one piece on the board; once inserted, pieces cannot be moved.  
One of the more special characteristics of this game is that the choice of the piece to be placed on the board is not made by the same player who places it; it is the opponent who, after doing his move, decides which will be the next piece to place.

So, each turn consists of two actions:

1. Place on the board the piece given by the opponent.  
2. Give to the opponent the piece to be placed in the next move.

In the first turn of the game, the player who starts has only to choose one piece for the opponent.
